# Project Overview

The purpose of my portfolio project is to showcase my skills, experience, and the projects I've worked on as a software engineer. It serves as a central hub for presenting my professional profile and acts as an interactive resume for potential employers and collaborators. This project aims to solve the problem of efficiently communicating my qualifications and providing a comprehensive view of my abilities to anyone interested in my work.
